/*	reference to msdn
 DCBlength
 Specifies the DCB structure length, in e_uint8s.
 BaudRate
 Specifies the baud rate at which the communication device operates. It is an actual baud rate value, or one of the following baud rate indexes: CBR_110 CBR_19200
 CBR_300 CBR_38400
 CBR_600 CBR_56000
 CBR_1200 CBR_57600
 CBR_2400 CBR_115200
 CBR_4800 CBR_128000
 CBR_9600 CBR_256000
 CBR_14400


 fBinary
 Specifies if binary mode is enabled. The Win32 API does not support nonbinary mode transfers, so this member must be TRUE. Using FALSE will not work.
 fParity
 Specifies if parity checking is enabled. If this member is TRUE, parity checking is performed and errors are reported.
 fOutxCtsFlow
 Specifies if the CTS (clear-to-send) signal is monitored for output flow control. If this member is TRUE and CTS is turned off, output is suspended until CTS is sent again.
 fOutxDsrFlow
 Specifies if the DSR (data-set-ready) signal is monitored for output flow control. If this member is TRUE and DSR is turned off, output is suspended until DSR is sent again.
 fDtrControl
 Specifies the DTR (data-terminal-ready) flow control. This member can be one of the following values: Value Description
 DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE Disables the DTR line when the device is opened and leaves it disabled.
 DTR_CONTROL_ENABLE Enables the DTR line when the device is opened and leaves it on.
 DTR_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE Enables DTR handshaking. If handshaking is enabled, it is an error for the application to adjust the line by using the EscapeCommFunction function.


 fDsrSensitivity
 Specifies if the communications driver is sensitive to the state of the DSR signal. If this member is TRUE, the driver ignores any e_uint8s received, unless the DSR modem input line is high.
 fTXContinueOnXoff
 Specifies if transmission stops when the input buffer is full and the driver has transmitted the Xoffe_int8 e_int8acter. If this member is TRUE, transmission continues after the input buffer has come within XoffLim e_uint8s of being full and the driver has transmitted the Xoffe_int8 e_int8acter to stop receiving e_uint8s. If this member is FALSE, transmission does not continue until the input buffer is within XonLim e_uint8s of being empty and the driver has transmitted the Xone_int8 e_int8acter to resume reception.
 fOutX
 Specifies if XON/XOFF flow control is used during transmission. If this member is TRUE, transmission stops when the Xoffe_int8 e_int8acter is received and starts again when the Xone_int8 e_int8acter is received.
 fInX
 Specifies if XON/XOFF flow control is used during reception. If this member is TRUE, the Xoffe_int8 e_int8acter is sent when the input buffer comes within XoffLim e_uint8s of being full, and the Xone_int8 e_int8acter is sent when the input buffer comes within XonLim e_uint8s of being empty.
 fErrore_int8
 Specifies if e_uint8s received with parity errors are replaced with the e_int8acter specified by the Errore_int8 member. If this member is TRUE and the fParity member is TRUE, replacement occurs.
 fNull
 Specifies if null e_uint8s are discarded. If this member is TRUE, null e_uint8s are discarded when received.
 fRtsControl
 Specifies the RTS (request-to-send) flow control. If this value is zero, the default is RTS_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE. This member can be one of the following values: Value Description
 RTS_CONTROL_DISABLE Disables the RTS line when the device is opened and leaves it disabled.
 RTS_CONTROL_ENABLE Enables the RTS line when the device is opened and leaves it on.
 RTS_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE Enables RTS handshaking. The driver raises the RTS line when the “type-ahead” (input) buffer is less than one-half full and lowers the RTS line when the buffer is more than three-quarters full. If handshaking is enabled, it is an error for the application to adjust the line by using the EscapeCommFunction function.
 RTS_CONTROL_TOGGLE Specifies that the RTS line will be high if e_uint8s are available for transmission. After all buffered e_uint8s have been sent, the RTS line will be low.


 fAbortOnError
 Specifies if read and write operations are terminated if an error occurs. If this member is TRUE, the driver terminates all read and write operations with an error status if an error occurs. The driver will not accept any further communications operations until the application has acknowledged the error by calling the ClearCommError function.
 fDummy2
 Reserved; do not use.
 wReserved
 Not used; set to zero.
 XonLim
 Specifies the minimum number of e_uint8s accepted in the input buffer before the XON e_int8acter is sent.
 XoffLim
 Specifies the maximum number of e_uint8s accepted in the input buffer before the XOFF e_int8acter is sent. The maximum number of e_uint8s accepted is calculated by subtracting this value from the size, in e_uint8s, of the input buffer.
 e_uint8Size
 Specifies the number of bits in the e_uint8s transmitted and received.
 Parity
 Specifies the parity scheme to be used. It is one of the following values: Value Description
 EVENPARITY Even
 MARKPARITY Mark
 NOPARITY No parity
 ODDPARITY Odd
 SPACEPARITY Space


 StopBits
 Specifies the number of stop bits to be used. It is one of the following values: Value Description
 ONESTOPBIT 1 stop bit
 ONE5STOPBITS 1.5 stop bits
 TWOSTOPBITS 2 stop bits


 Xone_int8
 Specifies the value of the XON e_int8acter for both transmission and reception.
 Xoffe_int8
 Specifies the value of the XOFF e_int8acter for both transmission and reception.
 Errore_int8
 Specifies the value of the e_int8acter used to replace e_uint8s received with a parity error.
 Eofe_int8
 Specifies the value of the e_int8acter used to signal the end of data.
 Evte_int8
 Specifies the value of the e_int8acter used to signal an event.
 wReserved1
 Reserved; do not use.
